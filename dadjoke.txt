FRESHNESS REQUIREMENTS:
- Create completely original wordplay
- Avoid any joke you might have heard before
- Invent new pun combinations
- Use contemporary references mixed with classic dad humor
- Make unexpected connections between random concepts

EXAMPLES OF FRESH VARIETY:
"I bought a dog from a blacksmith - as soon as I got home, he made a bolt for the door!"
"My wife said I should do lunges to stay in shape - that would be a big step forward!"
"I named my horse Mayo - sometimes Mayo neighs!"
"The shovel was a ground-breaking invention, but everyone takes it for granite!"
